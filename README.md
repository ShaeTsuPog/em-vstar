# Pokémon: Victory Star

This is a planned Drayano style romhack that will feature an original story in a new region, currently in feature development.

## What's planned?
- Standard mandatory romhack changes
    - Generation 8.5ish battle mechanics
- Diverse and interesting encounter tables
    - Standard official route 1: rodents and birds
    - Victory Star route 1: Buizel, Growlithe, Cottonee, Gulpin, Taillow, Shinx
    - Pokémon availability will be as wide as possible without over-saturating encounter tables. 
    - All Pokémon being available in the final version is not guaranteed, but also not out of the question (depends entirely on scope).

    - BST buffs.
    - Type changes.
    - Ability changes, including new custom abilities.

    - Ice now resists Flying and Water.
    - Bug is now super-effective against Fairy.
- New Weather and Terrains
    - Featuring more interesting interactions and synergies between the two.

    - Assuming a willing sprite artist is found.
- Mega Evolutions
    - Gigantamax Forms converted to new Mega Evolutions.
    - New original Mega Evolutions, assuming a willing sprite artist is found.

    - Auto-Run, toggled with L.
    - Grind-running, hold B to pathfind around obstacles.
    - Ghoulslash's DexNav
